OPM &gt; Portfolio &gt; Program &gt; Project

OPM: Guide to focus on strategy

Project Management Office:

* Supportive: policies, templates, lessons
* Controlling: support on how to manage 
* Directive: responsible for results

Org Structure:

* Functional: group of specializations
* Project-oriented: organized by projects
* Matrix: mixture of the above.
  * Project expediter: assistant and communication coordinator
  * Project coordinator: reports to higher lever managers.

## **Quality:**

Attribute sapling measures the quality of items in a sample on a pass/fail basis

Variable sampling measures the quality on a continuous scale

Prevention: errors out of the process

Inspection: errors out of the customers

Control Quality:

Manage Quality: Quality audit

Cost of Non-conformance: internal and external failures.

## **Communication:**

Pull: for large audience

## **Resource:**

Resource leveling is used when resources are under or over allocated. Resource smoothing is used when resources are unevenly allocated. Resource leveling can be applied to activities on the critical path while in resource smoothing you do not touch activities on the critical path.

**Tuckman ladder:**

Forming: The team meets and independent \(working on their own\)

Storming: Not collaborative and open to ideas, the team is counterproductive \(they don’t like each other, difference in opinion, ego clashes\)

Norming: Begin to work, adjust their habits, and trust each other \(After visiting the resort, team starts working towards the project\)

Performing: The team is interdependent and works effectively \(always speaking about the project\)

Adjourning: Staff releases as the work gets completed \(they make project success and may go back to their respective functions\) What are you waiting for? If you are a project manager, please take the team to a recreational outing. If you are not a team member, ask to go to a resort. If you are in the senior management, encourage the project team to visit a resort during the weekend and importantly, fund the same.

**RACI** is an acronym that stands for responsible, accountable, consulted and informed. A RACI chart is a matrix of all the activities or decision making authorities undertaken in an organisation set against all the people or roles. At each intersection of activity and role it is possible to assign somebody responsible, accountable, consulted or informed for that activity or decision.

**Resource Management Plan**: Information regarding team roles, responsibilities, authorities, and competencies.

Responsible: person who performs an activity or does the work.

Accountable: person who is ultimately accountable and has Yes/No/Veto.

Consulted: person that needs to feedback and contribute to the activity.

Informed: person that needs to know of the decision or action.

## **Scheduling:**

Crashing: Add resources to your project so you can finish faster. Crashing almost always involves a financial cost.

Fast-tracking: Perform tasks in parallel so you can finish faster. Overlapping tasks in this way often increases risk.

Monte Carlo: used to analyze cost, schedule, risk using computer software. It provides possibilities and scenarios based on inputs provided.

Free Load:

Three-point estimates: Estimated Duration = \(Most Likely Duration \* 4 + Most Optimistic Duration + Most Pessimistic Duration\) / 6

Backward Pass: Calculate late finish dates and alate start dates for uncompleted portion.

**Integration:**

Monitor and Control Project Work

Direct and Manage Project Work

**Configuration Control**: Focus on the specification of both the processes and deliverables

**Change Control**: Focus on project changes and the product baselines
