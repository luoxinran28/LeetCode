# Behavior Questions

## Can you give me a short self introduction please? 

I graduated from University of Utah for my Master of Computer Science degree in 2015. And I also got my MBA degree from Indiana University in 2019. Currently, I am working for Dell EMC for about 5 years as a Front-end developer. My job title right now is Senior Software Engineer. I'm living and working in Draper / Utah. My job responsibility is to collaborate with the team and create pages and reusable components using HTML, JS, and CSS for the business groups. The current project I'm working on is to migrate the existing code from a legacy system to a new system, which involves the new design for hundreds of pages across more than 20 locales. Please feel free to ask me the details if you want to know more.

如果Engineer问，Engineer的侧重点： 

1. 这个项目是做什么的 
2. **你具体负责了哪一块?** 
3. **某一个具体的use case，你是如何解决的** 
4. 描述**功能**，具体的**使用案例**，以及**解决方案。**不要过多**深挖算法**，**数据结构** 

I was able to work a font-end project with a colleague last year. The goal was to replace the older search engine from Goolge kernal to Coveo framework on dellemc.com/search. My job was to implement the new page design in time and connect the back-end api to make sure the search result is as expected. It required a lot of communication among the PM, FA and BE developers. It was a very intensive 4 months projects because the deadline was rush and a lot of new requirement happened in the proecess. The trickiest part was we have to make decision on the tools we need to such as the vanilla JS, Vue JS, or jQuery. To make the decision, we always need to consider how much resources we have such as timeline, budget, group size, maintenance, so on and so forth. We alway did some trials and fully disscused everytime we made the decision. The good thing was we finished the project on time and managers were very satisfied with the page we made.

## Why are you looking for a change?

* Why did you leave your previous company/position?
* Is there anything you did not like for your previous position?

My current company is my first company since I have graduated from school. In the last several years, my current company help me grow as a professional developer. I really appreciate that. After working there for almost 6 years, I feel I'm too familiar with my current work process and technology stack. I want some more challenges for myself and learn something different in both technology and company culture.

## What do you like the most for your current/previous position?

My current position gives a lot of freedom to do our own things. They fully supported us to learn things we like in the spare time. Because of this, I can finish my part-time MBA degree and the company also supported me a lot financially. I really appreciate this.

* What is your biggest strength
I consider myself a quick learner and a knowledge lover. As a front-end developer, we always have some new tools coming out each and I always learn these tools very fast. Also I am a self-motivated person to learn new things. I am also an easy-going person and easy to communicate any coming problems.


## What do you like the least for your current/previous position?

* What’s the biggest mistake you’ve ever made in your previous job?
So I've been working in this company for about more than four years, if I have anything I really don't like, I would've left this company. However, if I have to say something that's not pefect, I would say we have too many daily meetings. But I don't really think this is a big problem because I believe communication is an important factor in the work.

* What is your biggest weakness?
Sometimes I focus on the detail implementatoin too much and ignored the overall process of the project. As an engineer, I always want my product has the best performance but it sometimes impact the productivity. But I've awared of it and tried to improve it because done is better than the perfect.

## How do you deal with conflict between team members?

* What if your opinion is different than your manager?
* What if you can't reach an agreement with your team members?

It's great thing to see if the conflict happens because it means everybody has their own opionion on the project and they are providing the different ideas. If the conflict happens, I would like to communicate their opinion and understand the reason behind it. And we need to compare the different opinion and discuss which opinion can best fit our current situation and the roadplan. We will make the decision after understanding all the trade-offs, and after that, the conflict can be resolved usually.

## What is the most challenging situation you’ve ever encountered?

* Describe a difficult situation in your previous job?
* What would you do if there’s limited resources/time(tight deadline)?

As a Computer Science student with a Master degree, I always want to try something fancy to show my ability in the web development, even though it's not quite necessasary. Sometimes I'm too focsing on the detail to improve the small part of the performace and ignoreed the overall big picture. Sometimes this could affect our schedule because of this. But usually after knowing more about the project in general through several conversaions with the colleages, I could change my mind of focusing on too much in detail because getting things done is more important than getting things perfectly.
