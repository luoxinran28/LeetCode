# Behavior Questions

## Can you give me a short self introduction please? 

I graduated from University of Utah for my Master of Computer Science degree in 2015. And I also got my MBA degree from Indiana University in 2019. Currently, I am working for Dell EMC for about 5 years as a Front-end developer. My job title right now is Senior Software Engineer. I'm living and working in Draper / Utah. My job responsibility is to collaborate with the team and create pages and reusable components using HTML, JS, and CSS for the business groups. The current project I'm working on is to migrate the existing code from a legacy system to a new system, which involves the new design for hundreds of pages across more than 20 locales. Please feel free to ask me the details if you want to know more.
