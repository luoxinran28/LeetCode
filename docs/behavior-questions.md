# Behavior Questions

## Can you give me a short self introduction please?

Hi. My name is Sean. In 2015, I graduated from University of Utah for my Master of Computer Science degree. My major focus was on Data Analysis. Then, I found my current job in Dell EMC as a Software Engineer to build their official Website. Dell EMC is the global leader in Storage, Servers, and Cloud management. I was helping them to display and sell their products and services on dellemc.com. I like learning things. I did both Back-end and Front-end in my job and earned my MBA degree sponsored by my company.

In my day-to-day work, I am a front-end developer in the majority of the time. I work very closely with my Product Manager and User-experience Designers. We use a Content Management System under the Adobe framework to create the components for the marketing users so they can create page content by using these components. We get feedback directly from them and improve our page component iteratively in the Agile development model. 

As a team lead, I need to estimate the development work size and prioritize the tasks with my manager. And I review the colleagues' code and demonstrate the work in our Sprint Demo meeting. We need to consider all kinds of scenarios such as browser compatibility, languages, cultures and performance of the page loading. \(The most recent project I am working on is to replace the search engine kernel from Google to Coveo framework, which requires us to coordinates with several other teams because this is impacting our customers' experience in the company wide. Another project is to create a form component to replace the current hard-coded forms so the marketing people can have more control to repetitively create the forms in the same experience.\)

Working in such global wide company, I am happy to meet the people from all different countries such as Argentina, Columbia, and India. The diversity pushes us more to schedule and coordinate our work well. I believe my experience could help XXX expand your business and develop the best product experience in the work wide. Thank you.

您好，我叫罗欣然。在2015年的时候，我从犹他大学计算机硕士毕业，当时主要学习数据分析方向。毕业之后我就作为软件工程师加入了现在这家公司，戴尔EMC。戴尔EMC是全球存储器、服务器和云管理的领导者。而我主要帮助在dellemc.com上面展示并销售他们的产品及服务。我很喜欢学习，我从事过前后端的开发，并在公司的资助下，我拿到了我的MBA学位。

日常工作中，我主要是一名前端开发人员，使用Adobe旗下的一款内容管理系统来创造组件，那市场部门的同事们就使用我们创造的组件来创立网站页面去提供他们展示的包括文字、图片、文档、视频等内容。在此期间，我们就根据他们的使用反馈来迭代我们日常开发。这里我们使用的是敏捷开发模型进行日常的迭代。

作为一名小组领导，我需要跟我的经理以及交互设计师进行交流，一起预估我们的开发时间以及优先级，我需要审查我同事的代码并且将我们的工作在展示会议上进行演示。我们的前端代码必须要考虑如浏览器兼容性、国际语言、性能及阅读顺序等等情况。我最近的一个项目就是将我们主页的搜索引擎替换到Coveo框架，由于这个将影响到整个网站的用户体验，我们要不断的跟不同部门去沟通解释可能受到影响的地方。另一个项目是创建一个表单组件，用来代替现在用html写死的表单，这样我们的市场部门就可以重复使用这个组件来创造具有相同体验的表单。

在这么一个全球影响力的公司上班，我很高兴能够和全世界各个地方的同事一起工作，他们来自例如阿根廷，哥伦比亚，印度等国家。这种地域的多样性就要求我们必须要计划和协作都配合得很好。不过我相信我的工作经历以及产品开发的经验一定将会对贵公司展开全球业务以及提升国际化的产品体验有非常大的帮助。以上就是我的一个简短的自我介绍。谢谢。

I believe XXX company has a series of great products such as YYY and ZZZ to help the world a better place to live. A lot of people's lifestyle has been changed because of these products. I think my experience on the web development would be a great fit for these products and I believe I can I do a lot of things in XXX and will enjoy the process to create the tools to help more people on a bigger impact.

## Can you briefly introduce one of your favorite project

2. **你具体负责了哪一块?** 
3. **某一个具体的use case，你是如何解决的** 
4. 描述**功能**，具体的**使用案例**，以及**解决方案。**不要过多**深挖算法**，**数据结构** 

I was able to work a font-end project with a colleague last year. The goal was to replace the older search engine kernel by using Coveo framework on dellemc.com/search. My job was to implement the new search page design on the front-end and render the corresponding result based on the request. So the work flow is similar to the typical search engine. We need to firstly index the page content to map by setting up the urls we are going to crawl. The pages are grabbed into as an instance which we call the Source. So by setting up the condition of the meta data, we will decide what information we need to show on the page as the search result and what webpages can be shown in the specific pipeline. After we get the data, we can create our search page to request the data in the search engine.

We firstly need to send the Oath2 token to the secure server to get the access to our Coveo platform. Then we use the token to connect Coveo to request the result. There are two stages here, building the query and processing the query. We have set up the different events emitters based on the two stages to manipulate our result such as beforeBuildQuery, before/afterComponentsInitialization, querySuccess,  beforeProcessResults, and newQuery. 

We can use the Advanced Expression with some basic regular expression to setup the data category types, timestamps and so on. And we use another Constant Expression to render the different result by default based on the sites. The search page will be configured with the analytical tool to track the usage of the page and the data will be sent to Coveo platform under specific API for the machine learning purpose.  

The page has been deployed to more than 20 languages across more than 110 locales. So we did a lot compatibility work for the languages and browsers. 



It required a lot of communication among the PM, FA and BE developers. It was a very intensive 4 months projects because the deadline was rush and a lot of new requirement happened in the middle. The trickiest part was we have to make decision on the tools based on needs such as the vanilla JS, Vue JS, or jQuery. To make the decision, we always need to consider how much resource we have such as timeline, budget, group size, maintenance, so on and so forth. We always did some trials and fully discussed every time we made the decision. The good thing was we finished the project on time and managers were very satisfied with the page we made.

## Why are you looking for a change?

* Why did you leave your previous company/position?
* Is there anything you did not like for your previous position?

My current company is my first company since I graduated from school. In the last several years, my current company help me grow as a professional developer. I really appreciate that. After working there for almost 5 years, I feel I'm too familiar with my current work process and technology stack. I want some more challenges for myself and learn something different in both technology and company culture.

## What do you like the most for your current/previous position?

My current position gives a lot of freedom to do our own things. They fully supported us to learn things we like in the spare time. Because of this, I can finish my part-time MBA degree and the company also supported me a lot financially. I really appreciate this.

#### What is your biggest strength

I consider myself a quick learner and a knowledge lover. As a front-end developer, we always have some new tools coming out each year and I always learn these tools very fast. Also I am a self-motivated person to learn new things. I am also an easy-going person and easy to communicate any coming problems.

## What do you like the least for your current/previous position?

#### What’s the biggest mistake you’ve ever made in your previous job?

So I've been working in this company for about five years, if I have anything I really don't like, I would've left this company. However, if I have to say something that's not perfect, I would say we have too many daily meetings. But I don't really think this is a big problem because I believe communication is an important factor in the work.

#### What is your biggest weakness?

Sometimes I focus on the detail implementation too much and ignored the overall process of the project. As an engineer, I always want my product has the best performance but it sometimes impact the productivity. But I've realized it and tried to improve it because done is better than the perfect.

## How do you deal with conflict between team members?

* What if your opinion is different than your manager?
* What if you can't reach an agreement with your team members?

It's great thing to see if the conflict happens because it means everybody has their own opinion on the project and they are providing the different ideas. If the conflict happens, I would like to communicate their opinion and understand the reason behind it. And we need to compare the different opinion and discuss which opinion can best fit our current situation and the plan. We will make the decision after understanding all the trade-offs, and after that, the conflict can be resolved usually.

## What is the most challenging situation you’ve ever encountered?

* Describe a difficult situation in your previous job?
* What would you do if there’s limited resources/time\(tight deadline\)?

As a Computer Science background, I always want to try something fancy to show my ability in the web development, even though it's not quite necessary. Sometimes I'm too focusing on the detail to improve the small part of the performance and ignored the overall big picture. Sometimes this could affect our schedule because of this. But usually after knowing more about the project in general through several conversations with the colleagues, I could change my mind of focusing on too much in detail because getting things done is more important than getting things perfectly.
