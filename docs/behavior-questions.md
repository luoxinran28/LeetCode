# Behavior Questions

## Can you give me a short self introduction please? 

I graduated from University of Utah for my Master of Computer Science degree in 2015. And I also got my MBA degree from Indiana University in 2019. Currently, I am working for Dell EMC for about 5 years as a Front-end developer. My job title right now is Senior Software Engineer. I'm living and working in Draper / Utah. My job responsibility is to collaborate with the team and create pages and reusable components using HTML, JS, and CSS for the business groups. The current project I'm working on is to migrate the existing code from a legacy system to a new system, which involves the new design for hundreds of pages across more than 20 locales. Please feel free to ask me the details if you want to know more.

## Why are you interested in our Company? 

* Why did you apply? 
* Why do you think you are a good fit? 
* Why Google/Amazon/pFacebook? 
* Why should we hire you? 
* What makes you the best candidate? 

I believe XXX company has created a series of greate products such as YYY and ZZZ to help the world a better place to live. My experience on the web development would be a greate fit for these products and I believe I would enjoy the process to create the tools to help more people on a bigger impact.

##  Can you briefly introduce one of your favorite project 

  
如果是HR问，HR的侧重点：

如果Engineer问，Engineer的侧重点： 

1. 这个项目是做什么的

## Why are you looking for a change?

* Why did you leave your previous company/position?
* Is there anything you did not like for your previous position?

My current company is my first company since I have graduated from school. In the last several years, my current company help me grow as a professional developer. I really appreciate that. After working there for almost 6 years, I feel I'm too familiar with my current work process and technology stack. I want some more challenges for myself and learn something different in both technology and company culture.

## What do you like the most for your current/previous position?

* What is your biggest strength


## What do you like the least for your current/previous position?

* What is your biggest weakness?
* What’s the biggest mistake you’ve ever made in your previous job?

## How do you deal with conflict between team members?

* What if your opinion is different than your manager?
* What if you can't reach an agreement with your team members?


## What is the most challenging situation you’ve ever encountered?

* Describe a difficult situation in your previous job?
* What would you do if there’s limited resources/time(tight deadline)?

As a Computer Science student with a Master degree, I always want to try something fancy to show my ability in the web development, even though it's not quite necessasary. Sometimes I'm too focsing on the detail to improve the small part of the performace and ignoreed the overall big picture. Sometimes this could affect our schedule because of this. But usually after knowing more about the project in general through several conversaions with the colleages, I could change my mind of focusing on too much in detail because getting things done is more important than getting things perfectly.
